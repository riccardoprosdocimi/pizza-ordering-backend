# pizza-ordering-backend
A modular, extensible backend system for a pizza ordering service â€” built using Python, object-oriented design, and real-world patterns. Includes support for pizzas, drinks, desserts, discounts, and persistence. Originally inspired by an Amazon interview question, which I bombed.
